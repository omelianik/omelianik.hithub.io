    <p>Bear Grylls who is renowned for his reality show ‘Man vs. Wild’, is an adventurer, traveller and explorer. Adventure sports such mountaineering, sailing and sky diving interested him ever since he was a child. He got trained in these sports by his father who was associated with the ‘Royal Yacht Squadron’. He was keen to learn martial arts and at an early age earned a black belt and even became a cub scout when he was eight years old. Adventures are accompanied by risks and demand immense physical as well as mental strength. Bear too had to face many injuries and at one such occasion he even landed up injuring his spine. This courageous individual not only emerged of the bodily injury but also overcame his psychological hindrances. His determination to climb Mount Everest remained undeterred and with his intense determination he again ushered into his adventurous pursuits, when people were sceptical about his locomotive organs being functional. Since then he has been more zealous and has also established himself as a television presenter of reality shows where he embarks on adventures. </p>

        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>When I was offered this job, after I have read the requirements, some warm memories about my Boy Scout years started to come up. I was very delighted of this opportunity because I myself knew how important survival skills are. This is why I decided to add some of my own useful knowledge to this website.</p>
        <h3>Difficulties:</h3>
        <p>During this project, I had to overcome many different difficulties, mostly consistent with the layout of the page. To save time I have used bootstrap templates and customized them to fit my website. Sometimes the templates were completely different from what I needed to achieve, and the overriding process was quite tricky. In addition, my project requires many separate pages, which needed precise detail and were hard to manage. I have also changed my design quite a few times, which made and every time new difficulties would occur. MOst of the challanges came from responcive design, it is a very tricky part fo the website.< /p>

        <h3>Maximus Wasowski</h3>
        <p>About 2 years ago max and his wife Jennet Wasowski decided to go on an exiting vocation in to Brazil. Instead of a hotel, they picked a small but cosy villa right by the beach. It was in a remote location, 2 hours by car from the nearest village, so they bought everything needed for 10 days vocation. But little did they know what was about to happened. On day 4 Max an Jennet came up with an idea to go out into the jungle and observe the wild world. They took a machete and a water bottle each. After 3 hours of wondering around jungle, they understood that were walking in circles and were completely lost. For the next 24 days they were putting themselves to the test, luckily they were able to get attention of a rescue helicopter that was patrolling the area. In one of the interviews, Max and his wife said it would be much easier if only they knew what to do in a situation of this kind. About a month ago to me with a job. He was willing to create a website that was user friendly and easy to understand. Max wanted to create a free platform, for people with no survival experience to understand the concepts of surviving which could help them in the future.</p>
